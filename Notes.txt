numerical
cetrality mearsure are numeric values with a standard increment can be measured via mean & median
dispersion measure are range, percentiles, variance, standard deviation

categorical - aka dimensions
total count
unique count
category counts and proportions
per category stats

median is the middle of a all the values of numbers. If all values are an even number it takes the 2 middle numbers and
calculates the median by (v1+v2) / 2 = y

range calculated by
max - min = y
small numbers means the values are close together. easily affected by outliers

percentile
Quartiles how many values fall in 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, 76-100
Box - Whisker plot based on quartiles
The box is 25 to 75 percent. Line in the box is 50% whiskers and top and bottom are the range from min to max values.
min & max values exclude extreme values.
IQR Inter-quartile range is the difference between the 25th to 75 percentile. It is the higth of the box.
dots above or below the whiskers represents the outliers. outliers = beyond 1.5 * IQR

variance
variance = sum((value-mean)squared) / count
variance affected by extreme values
also unit is not clear due to the squaring.

standard deviation
is the square root of the variance

counts and proportions
values and the counts of those unique values. Proportions is the percentage those values within the column.

Distributions
    -Univariate is looking at the data by only one attribute. Histogram, Kernel Density Estimation KDE plots
    -Bivariate use Scatter plot

Mean Impuation for missing values.
Basically you just add the mean for any values that are missing.
Median Imputation is the better solution.
For sequential time based data you can use the values before or after your missing data.
Predictive modeling is also a possibility for missing values.

# Categorical feature encoding.
# binary encoding works when you only have 2 values and can set them to 0 or 1
# Lable encoding assigning values a numeric value 1=low, 2=medium, etc
# one-hot encoding is creating a feature for each value for instance Embarked values is A, B, or C you would create
# a new column of Is_A set to 0 or 1 Is_B set to 0 or 1, etc
